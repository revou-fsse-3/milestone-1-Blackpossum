## setting and Establishing custom domain and register it into Netlify

### Deploy new website to Existing Custom Domain
in order to register custom domain on netlify, you need to have a custom domain first
go to domain hosting provider to buy a custom domain, in this tutorial guide i will use __Niagahoster__ as my domain registrar for my costume domain.

1. go to Niagahoster site, and buy a domain name for your site here i provide you the link 
go to (https://www.niagahoster.co.id/domain-murah)

2. you will be redirected to niaga hoster page, type your domain name and cek for availability of the domain, is it already taken or not

5. back to netlify tab,after your domain is active , netlify also provide TLS encryption for your domain an sub domain, these encryption is use for secure site request , in other words convert HTTP to HTTPS 
you can check by scrolling down the page
